# Web-Map-using-Python-and-Folium
Here I have created a web map that is displayed through a browser and can be visited through the web. This map is built with Python and Folium. The map has three layers. It has a base map layer, a polygon layer which represents the population of the countries and also a point layer to point different volcanoes in USA.
