# Web-Map-using-Python-and-Folium
Here I have created a web map that is displayed through a browser and can be visited through the web. This map is built with Python and Folium. The map has three layers. It contains a base map layer, a polygon layer which represents the population of the countries and also a marker layer to point different volcanoes in USA. Here I have also implemented a feature by adding a layer control panel that allows me to turn the custom layers on and off.

Requires:
1. Python(pip,folium,pandas)
2. leaflet
3. GeoJson.io(from mapbox)
